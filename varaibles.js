// Varaibles are used to store data that can be used throughout the application.
// They can be used to store configuration settings, user preferences, or any other data that needs to be accessed globally.

// In js , we can create variables using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords.

// Keywords in programming languages are reserved words that have special meaning in the language. They are used to define the structure and behavior of the code. In JavaScript, keywords include `var`, `let`, `const`, `function`, `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, and many others.

// var was the original way to declare variables in JavaScript. Because of scope issues, it is now recommended to use let and const instead.
var username = "Albert";

// let is used to declare variables that can be reassigned later. It has block scope, meaning it is only accessible within the block it is defined in.
let age = 30;

// const is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned. It is also block scoped.
const pi = 3.14;

const role = "distributor";
let darkMode = false;
// let variables can be reassigned, but const variables cannot be reassigned.
age = 31;
// pi = 3.2;
